The heading really says it all, but, just for reference.
No reference voltage is necessary - no batteries to change, no fancy wiring -
just hook red to positive, black to negative.
Seems completely waterproof - it's all assembled through the front,
and then sealed with clear epoxy at the factory.
Do make sure about positive and negative - you might be able to fry this by
connecting it backwards.
